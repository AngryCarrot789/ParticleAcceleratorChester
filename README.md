# ParticleAcceleratorChester
A plugin for chesting particle accelerators (in atomic science) in minecraft 1.6.4 because they cause a tad bit of lag

in code, change the password to whatever you want and then ingame use the command like so:
/chestpa <your password>
and it will turn every particle accelerator into a chest (as long as theyre in loaded chunks).
